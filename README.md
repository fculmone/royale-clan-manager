This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is the frontend for a website I built that lets you manage your clash royale clan. You can check it out at https://royaleclanmanager.com. If you would like, you can check out my other repository for the backend [here](https://github.com/fculmone/python-api-clashroyale]).
